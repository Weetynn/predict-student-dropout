# Machine Learning in Education: A Comparative Study of Predictive Models for Student Dropout

## 📚 Introduction

With advancements in machine learning and data mining technologies, predicting student academic performance, specifically identifying students at risk of dropping out, has become a growing area of research. Educational Data Mining (EDM) applies data mining techniques to academic data, uncovering patterns related to student retention, dropout rates, and overall academic success. 

By leveraging student demographics, academic performance, and socioeconomic data, predictive models offer valuable insights that can help institutions implement proactive interventions to improve student outcomes. The increasing availability of big data and advanced analytics further enhances the potential for accurate predictions and timely support. These predictive insights not only benefit individual students but also contribute to improving institutional performance and educational quality on a broader scale.
